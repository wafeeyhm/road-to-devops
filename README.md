## Introduction

{% comment %}
The tutorial introduction should include the following in a short paragraph -

- Clarify audience
- State prerequisites and prior knowledge needed
- State what the user will accomplish or build and the user problem it solves
- Link to an example of the project the user will complete
{% endcomment %}

## Step 1: Action the user will take

{% comment %}
In one sentence, describe what the user will do in this step
Steps should break down the tasks the user will complete in sequential order
Avoid replicating conceptual information that is covered elsewhere, provide inline links instead. Only include conceptual information unique to this use case.
{% endcomment %}

### Task chunk

{% comment %}
A step may require the user to perform several tasks - break those tasks down into chunks, allowing the user to scan quickly to find their place if they navigated away from this screen to perform the task.
An example might be creating a personal access token for the action to use and then storing it in secrets
For UI based tasks, include the button or options the users should click
If the task adds code, include the code in context (don't just show `needs: setup` show the entire `setup` and `dependent` jobs)
{% endcomment %}

### Another task chunk

## Step 2: Do the next thing

{% comment %}
Rinse and repeat, adding steps and tasks until the tutorial is complete
Remember to show code snippets in context
{% endcomment %}

## Further reading

{% comment %}
Include a bulleted list of tutorials or articles the user can reference to extend the concepts taught in this tutorial
